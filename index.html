            The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar
            Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house
            the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the

            The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːl qiːlaː]) is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of

            commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12th May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra
            to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also
            constructed the Taj Mahal.
